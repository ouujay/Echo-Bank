# What We Built - EchoBank Company Integration System

## THE REAL ARCHITECTURE

EchoBank is a **B2B SaaS Voice API Service** for banks. Here's how it works:

---

## 1. COMPANY REGISTRATION

Banks (like Zenith, Access, GT Bank) sign up to use EchoBank:

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/companies/register`

```json
{
  "company_name": "Zenith Bank",
  "email": "api@zenithbank.com",
  "contact_person": "John Doe",
  "phone": "+234123456789",
  "password": "zenith123"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "company_id": 1,
  "api_key": "echobank_yGWxML5E7CfImVTMJj0UQGyXX0lzwiQ2l72Hkb-8oCQ",
  "message": "Save your API key!"
}
```

✅ **WE TESTED THIS - IT WORKS!**

---

## 2. ENDPOINT CONFIGURATION

After registration, banks configure THEIR API endpoints:

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/companies/1/endpoints`

```json
{
  "base_url": "https://api.zenithbank.com",
  "auth_type": "bearer",
  "auth_header_name": "Authorization",

  "get_balance_endpoint": "/api/v1/accounts/{account_number}/balance",
  "get_recipients_endpoint": "/api/v1/accounts/{account_number}/beneficiaries",
  "initiate_transfer_endpoint": "/api/v1/transfers/initiate",
  "confirm_transfer_endpoint": "/api/v1/transfers/{transfer_id}/confirm",
  "verify_pin_endpoint": "/api/v1/auth/verify-pin"
}
```

This tells EchoBank: "When my users speak, call THESE endpoints in MY system."

---

## 3. HOW USERS INTERACT

### User Flow:

1. **User logs into Zenith Bank app** (gets Zenith's token)
2. **User taps voice button** in Zenith app
3. **Zenith app sends**:
   - Audio file
   - User's account number
   - User's Zenith token
   - Company ID (1 for Zenith)
   - Zenith's EchoBank API key

4. **EchoBank**:
   - Transcribes audio (OpenAI Whisper)
   - Parses intent (LLM)
   - Calls **ZENITH'S ENDPOINTS** with user's Zenith token
   - Gets data from Zenith's system
   - Returns voice response

---

## 4. EXAMPLE: "Send 5000 to John"

```
User speaks: "Send 5000 naira to John"
   ↓
Zenith app → EchoBank: Audio + user's Zenith token + Company ID
   ↓
EchoBank: Transcribes → "Send 5000 naira to John"
   ↓
EchoBank: Parses intent → transfer(recipient="John", amount=5000)
   ↓
EchoBank → Zenith API: GET /beneficiaries (with user's token)
   ↓
Zenith API → EchoBank: [John Doe, account: 1234567890]
   ↓
EchoBank → Zenith API: POST /transfers/initiate {amount: 5000, recipient: "1234567890"}
   ↓
Zenith API → EchoBank: {transfer_id: "TXN123", fee: 10.50}
   ↓
EchoBank → Zenith app: "Sending 5,000 naira to John. Say your PIN."
```

## 5. WHAT WE BUILT

### Database Tables:

1. **`companies`** - Banks that use EchoBank
   - company_name, email, api_key, is_active

2. **`company_endpoints`** - Each bank's API endpoints
   - company_id, base_url, get_balance_endpoint, etc.

### API Endpoints:

1. **`POST /api/v1/companies/register`** - Company registration ✅ TESTED
2. **`POST /api/v1/companies/{id}/endpoints`** - Configure endpoints
3. **`GET /api/v1/companies/{id}`** - Get company info
4. **`GET /api/v1/companies/{id}/endpoints`** - View endpoints

### Services:

1. **`CompanyAPIClient`** - Calls the bank's registered endpoints
   - `get_balance()` - Calls bank's balance endpoint
   - `get_recipients()` - Calls bank's recipients endpoint
   - `initiate_transfer()` - Calls bank's transfer endpoint
   - `confirm_transfer()` - Confirms with PIN

## 6. INTEGRATION GUIDE

Created: `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`

This guide shows banks:
- How to register
- How to configure endpoints
- Code examples (Android, React, JavaScript)
- Complete user flow diagrams
- Security information

---

## 7. WHAT'S NEXT

### To Complete Integration:

1. ✅ **Company Registration** - DONE
2. ✅ **Endpoint Configuration** - DONE
3. ✅ **Company API Client** - DONE
4. ⏳ **Update Voice Orchestrator** - Use company endpoints instead of mock
5. ⏳ **Test with Real Bank** - Need a bank to test with

### To Test:

1. Configure endpoints for Zenith Bank (company_id=1)
2. Send voice command with company_id=1
3. Verify EchoBank calls Zenith's endpoints
4. Verify response is correct

---

## 8. RUNNING SERVICES

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend**: http://localhost:8003
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (connected)

### Test Registration:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8003/api/v1/companies/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "company_name": "Access Bank",
    "email": "api@accessbank.com",
    "contact_person": "Jane Smith",
    "phone": "+234987654321",
    "password": "access123"
  }'
```

---

## KEY POINTS

1. **EchoBank doesn't store user data** - We just orchestrate voice intelligence
2. **Banks control everything** - They provide endpoints, we call them
3. **User tokens from bank** - Authentication stays with the bank
4. **PINs go to bank** - We pass them through, never store them
5. **B2B SaaS model** - Banks pay us, users don't see EchoBank branding

---

## FILES CREATED

1. `/backend/app/models/company.py` - Company and endpoints models
